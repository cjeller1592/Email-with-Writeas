# Email-with-Writeas
Send an email using a Write.as Post

<a href="https://Write.as/about"> Write.as </a> is an awesome platform for writing. 

I much prefer it to drafting a message in Gmail or any other email service. Why not draft emails in Write.as and send them out somehow? This is an attempt to do so.

Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/scorredoira/email> Scorredoira's email library </a> and the Write.as team.
  
<em> Requirements: </em>

```
go get github.com/scorredoira/email

go get go.code.as/writeas.v2

```

Have Fun!
